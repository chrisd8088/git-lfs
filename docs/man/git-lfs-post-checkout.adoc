== NAME

git-lfs-post-checkout - Git post-checkout hook implementation

== SYNOPSIS

[source,console,subs="verbatim,quotes",role=synopsis]
----
*git lfs post-checkout* <rev-before> <rev-after> <is-branch-checkout>
----

== DESCRIPTION

Responds to Git post-checkout events. It makes sure that any files which
are marked as `lockable` by `git lfs track` are read-only in the working
copy, if not currently locked by the local user.

When Git invokes a post-checkout hook it passes three parameters, all
of which are required by the `git lfs post-checkout` command.

The `<rev-before>` and `<rev-after>` arguments are expected to be the
SHAs of the commits from before and after the checkout, respectively.

The `<is-branch-checkout>` argument should be `1` if a branch or other
reference was checked out, and `0` if individual files were checked out.
