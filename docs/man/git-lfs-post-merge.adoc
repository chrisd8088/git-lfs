== NAME

git-lfs-post-merge - Git post-merge hook implementation

== SYNOPSIS

[source,console,subs="verbatim,quotes",role=synopsis]
----
*git lfs post-merge*
----

== DESCRIPTION

Responds to Git post-merge events. It makes sure that any files which
are marked as `lockable` by `git lfs track` are read-only in the working
copy, if not currently locked by the local user.

When Git invokes a post-merge hook it passes a single parameter, a status
flag which will have the value `1` if the current merge was a squash merge
and `0` otherwise. The `git lfs post-merge` command ignores this argument,
however, as it is not relevant when setting the permissions of `lockable`
files.
